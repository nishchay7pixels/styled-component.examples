## What and Why?

Styled component is a CSS in JS styling solution for React and React Native. It allow you to write
CSS for your component inside your Javascript code.

## Features

1. Keeps track of components rendered and only inject there style making amount of code injected less.
2. No bugs inroduced to code due to misspelled class names
3. Easier deletion of CSS. Since style is directly linked to the component we have more control in adding/removing unused styles/components.
4. Allow dynamic styling using props.
5. Easy to maintain.
